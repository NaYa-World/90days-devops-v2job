  interview: [
    {
      question: "Can you explain Linux file permissions to me?",
      answer: "Linux permissions are split into three groups: the owner of the file, the group it belongs to, and everyone else — called others. Each group gets three bits: read, write, and execute, represented as rwx. These map to numbers: r=4, w=2, x=1, so 7 means full access, 5 means read and execute, 4 means read only. A permission of 755 means the owner has full access, and the group and others can read and execute but not write. chmod is the command to change permissions, chown changes ownership. I use chmod 600 for private key files — only the owner can read, nobody else can touch it."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a process and a service?",
      answer: "A process is any running program — it has a Process ID, uses CPU and memory, and ends when its job is done. A service is a special type of process managed by systemd — it's designed to start at boot time, run continuously in the background, and be monitored and restarted if it crashes. For example, when I install nginx on a server, I use systemctl enable nginx to make it a service that starts automatically on every reboot, rather than having to manually start it each time."
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you use sudo and when wouldn't you?",
      answer: "sudo — superuser do — temporarily elevates your privileges to root level for a single command. I use it when I need to install packages, modify system configuration files in /etc, or manage services with systemctl. I would not use it for anything involving my own files in my home directory, or when writing application code. Running everything as root is dangerous because a bug or mistyped command has system-wide consequences — there's no safety net."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you diagnose a service that's failing to start — walk me through your process.",
      answer: "First step is always to check the service status: sudo systemctl status servicename — this shows the last few log lines and the exit code. If the status isn't enough detail, I go to the journal: journalctl -u servicename -n 50 gives me the last 50 log entries for that unit. If it's a port conflict — another process already using port 80 for example — I check with sudo ss -tlnp or lsof -i :80 to see what process has the port. For nginx specifically I also run sudo nginx -t to test config syntax before attempting a restart. I work top-down: service status → logs → config → resources — rather than restarting blindly and hoping."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you make a configuration change permanent on a Linux server vs just the current session?",
      answer: "It depends on what you're changing. For shell environment variables and aliases — things you want every time you log in — I add them to ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_profile for login shells). After editing, I run source ~/.bashrc to apply without logging out. For PATH changes, service configurations, or system-wide settings, it depends on the service: nginx config lives in /etc/nginx/, systemd unit files live in /etc/systemd/system/. For a service change, after editing the unit file I run systemctl daemon-reload and then systemctl restart or reload. The key mental model is: anything done in a terminal session is temporary — to make it survive reboots or new login sessions, it needs to be written to the appropriate config file."

## 🎯 What I Learned Today
- Linux filesystem hierarchy: why /etc holds config, /var holds logs
- File permissions with chmod: 755 vs 644 vs 600 explained in my own words
- The difference between a process (any running program) and a service (managed by systemd)
- How SSH key authentication works (public/private key pair)
- Log processing and text filtering using awk, cut, sort, uniq, and wc
- Centralised logging queries with journalctl and port verification using lsof/ss
- Environment exports, session aliases, and permanent .bashrc changes
- Remote file transfer via secure copy (scp) and compression with tar

## ⌨️ Commands I Actually Used

\`\`\`bash
# Navigation & Operations
pwd           # where am I?
ls -la        # list with permissions and hidden files
cd ~          # go home
cd /etc       # go to system config directory
tar -czf backup.tar.gz ~/scripts/  # compress directory
tar -xzf backup.tar.gz -C /tmp/    # extract directory

# Text Processing & Pipelines
df -h | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}'      # get disk use percentage
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1       # cut usernames from passwd
cat access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head  # analyze IPs
wc -l /var/log/syslog               # count log lines

# Services & Debugging
sudo systemctl status nginx
journalctl -u nginx -n 50           # modern systemd logs
journalctl -u nginx -f              # follow log stream
sudo lsof -i :80                    # see what process owns port 80
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :80            # socket stats alternative
scp -i key.pem file.txt ubuntu@IP:~/  # copy local to remote

# Shell Customization
export AWS_PROFILE=learning
alias gs='git status'
source ~/.bashrc
\`\`\`

## 🐛 Errors I Hit (and How I Fixed Them)

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Permission denied (publickey) | .pem file had wrong permissions | chmod 400 key.pem |
| mv: No such file or directory | Destination folder didn't exist | mkdir -p destination/ first |
| journalctl: No logs found | Service logs directed to custom file | Checked /var/log/nginx/error.log directly |
| Alias not working in script | Script executed in non-interactive shell | Changed alias to raw command or function in script |

## 🏗 Mini Project: server_setup.sh
- Script location: ~/devops-notes/server_setup.sh
- What it does: installs development tools on a fresh Ubuntu EC2
- Test result: Ran twice, no errors on second run ✅

## ❓ Questions I Still Have
- When is ss preferred over lsof in production environment audits?

## 📈 Tomorrow (Day 2)
Git + GitHub workflow + AWS account setup + first EC2 IAM user`
