# 90 Days of DevOps — Zero to Hired

A fully-featured, production-grade DevOps learning tracker built with **React 18 + TypeScript 5 + Vite**. Built for one goal: **getting a DevOps job in 90 days**, not just learning concepts.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start development server
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:5173

# 3. Run tests
npm test

# 4. Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🔑 AI Features Setup

Most AI features (mock interviews, resume ATS scanning, LinkedIn posts, code review) require an Anthropic API key.

**How to add your key:**
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click **🔑 Keys** in the top-right navigation
3. Paste your Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-...`)
4. Click Save

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here
```

> **Note:** If AI features show errors, open DevTools (F12) → Console and check:
> - `401` → wrong or missing API key
> - `CORS blocked` → use the `.env` file method instead of the settings modal
> - `model_not_found` → the model name in AIService.ts needs updating to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`

## 📋 What This App Does

This is not a tutorial tracker. It is a **job placement tool** with all the necessary views across two complete roadmaps.

### The Two Roadmaps

| | Original Roadmap (v4) | Problem-First Roadmap (v2) 💥 |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Topic-first (Learn Linux → Learn Docker → Learn K8s) | Problem-first ("Your server is broken. Fix it.") |
| **Day 1** | Study DevOps culture and CAMS model | Deploy a real app to a real AWS server |
| **Learning trigger** | Topic sequence | Production problems that force you to learn |
| **Progress storage** | `devops90_tasks` in localStorage | `devops90_v2_tasks` in localStorage |
| **Navigation** | ☑ Roadmap tab | 💥 v2 Roadmap tab |

Both roadmaps are available simultaneously. Progress is tracked separately.

## 🗂️ All Views

### Roadmaps
| View | What it does |
|---|---|
| ☑ **Roadmap** (v4) | Original topic-first 90-day plan. Phases, tasks, notes, confidence scoring, AI quiz per day |
| 💥 **v2 Roadmap** | NEW — Problem-first roadmap. Every day starts with a broken production scenario. |

### Job Outcome Tools
| View | What it does |
|---|---|
| 📄 **Resume** | Paste your resume → AI scores ATS keyword coverage → shows missing keywords per job level |

| 📊 **Skill Gap** | Paste any job description → see exact skills you have vs what the role requires |
| 🎯 **Readiness** | 8-gate readiness check. Tells you "apply now" vs "fix these 2 things first." |
| 🔗 **LinkedIn** | Converts your build logs into LinkedIn posts (3 tone options: technical, story, insight) |

### Daily Learning Tools
| View | What it does |
|---|---|
| ◎ **Focus** | Single-day deep work mode. One day, all its tasks, no distractions. |
| ⊞ **Kanban** | Drag tasks across Todo → In Progress → Done columns |
| ⌨ **Labs** | Interactive terminal simulator for Linux and Docker command practice |
| 🧰 **Projects** | 12 portfolio project specs with resume bullet points and interview talking points |
| ❓ **Qbank** | 200+ interview questions by category (Linux, Docker, K8s, CI/CD, Terraform) |
| 📝 **Notes** | Secure notes with local authentication and password protection |
| 🧑‍💻 **Sandbox** | Run arbitrary DevOps tools (Linux, Python, Git) in a real web container |

### Progress & Analytics
| View | What it does |
|---|---|
| 📈 **Stats** | Overall Progress, Weekly Goals, DORA metrics, readiness meters, XP level, Study hours, and Activity heatmap |
| 📅 **Goals** | Weekly goals, streak history, bounceback recovery after missed days |
| 🔨 **Build Log & Reviews** | Log what you built each day, and rate past tasks using spaced repetition to schedule reviews. |

## 🔄 The v2 Problem-First Roadmap — What Makes It Different

Every day follows this structure:

```
🔴 SCENARIO:   A real production problem (server down, data lost, CI broken)
💡 WHY THIS:   Why this problem teaches the concept better than a tutorial
   Tasks:      What you actually do to fix it
⚠️ GOTCHA:     The mistake everyone makes the first time
📝 NOTE:       Senior engineer insight you would not find in docs
🎤 INTERVIEW:  Exactly how to answer the interview question this scenario prepares you for
```

**Example — Day 4:** "The disk is full. The server refuses all connections."
You learn: `df -h`, `du -sh`, `find -mtime`, `logrotate`, disk monitoring cron — because your server is broken right now, not because you are following a syllabus.

---

## 📦 npm Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build        # TypeScript check + production bundle → dist/
npm run preview      # Serve the production build locally
npm test             # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch   # Re-run tests on every file save
npm run lint         # TypeScript type check only (no build)
```

---

## 🚢 Deploy to Vercel (Free)

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-tracker.git
git push -u origin main

# 2. Go to vercel.com → Import Project → Select repo → Deploy
# Vercel auto-detects Vite. No configuration needed.
# Your app is live in 60 seconds.

# 3. Add VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
```

---

## 🎯 The Goal

This tracker exists for one reason: **getting GK (and anyone using it) hired as a DevOps engineer**.

Every feature answers the question: *"Does this help someone get a DevOps job faster?"*

- Resume ATS scanner → pass the automated filter
- Mock interview → stop stumbling on questions you knew the answer to
- GitHub rewriter → make repos look professional before recruiters see them
- Readiness gates → apply at 65%, not when you feel "100% ready" (you never will)
- Problem-first roadmap → learn what hiring managers actually test, not just what topics exist
