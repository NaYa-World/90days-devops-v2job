      question: "What is a security group in AWS?",
      answer: "A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances. Inbound rules define what traffic can reach the instance — I always need port 22 open for SSH. If I'm running a web server, I also open port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. Outbound rules control what the instance can connect to — by default all outbound traffic is allowed. Security groups are stateful, meaning if I allow an inbound request, the response traffic is automatically allowed without needing an explicit outbound rule. This is different from network ACLs, which are stateless. Security groups are the first place I check when a service isn't reachable from outside — in about 60% of cases, a missing inbound rule is the problem."
    },
    {
      question: "What does nginx do and how did you deploy a web page with it?",
      answer: "Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy. In its simplest use case — which is what I did on Day 3 of my training — it serves static HTML files. I installed it on an EC2 instance, placed my HTML file in /var/www/html/, and nginx automatically served it to any browser that hit the instance's public IP on port 80. I configured the security group to allow port 80 inbound. To verify it was working I first used curl from inside the server to isolate nginx itself, then hit the public IP from my laptop's browser. I also learned that sudo nginx -t tests config syntax before applying it — you should always run that before a reload to avoid taking a site down with a config error."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe a deployment you've done — even a simple one.",
      answer: "I wrote a bash script that automates the full deployment of a web page to a fresh EC2 instance. It updates the package list, installs nginx and git, clones a GitHub repository, copies the HTML files to the nginx web root, then starts and enables nginx so it survives reboots. At the end it fetches the EC2's public IP from the instance metadata service and prints the URL. This script means I can take a brand new EC2 from launch to serving a web page in under 3 minutes without touching the AWS console. It's a simplified version of what CI/CD pipelines do at scale — the pipeline would also run tests and handle rollbacks, but the core concept is the same: pull code from a repository and deploy it to a server."

      ],
      explanation: "If nginx is running but the browser can't reach it, it's almost always the Security Group. Port 80 must have an inbound rule. Run: aws ec2 describe-security-groups and check IpPermissions for port 80."

      question: "What is the difference between systemctl restart and systemctl reload for nginx?",
      options: [
        { text: "A) They do the same thing — both restart the process", isCorrect: false },
        { text: "B) restart stops and starts nginx (drops connections); reload applies new config without stopping (zero downtime)", isCorrect: true },
        { text: "C) reload is only for security updates", isCorrect: false },
        { text: "D) restart is faster than reload", isCorrect: false }
      ],
      explanation: "reload = graceful config update. Active connections finish normally while new config is applied. Always prefer reload for config changes in production. Use restart only when reload fails or for major version upgrades."

      num: 3,
      question: "You edited nginx.conf and ran sudo systemctl reload nginx but the site broke. What should you have done BEFORE the reload?",
      options: [
        { text: "A) Backed up the config file", isCorrect: false },

        { text: "D) Checked the security group", isCorrect: false }
      ],
      explanation: "sudo nginx -t validates config syntax without touching the running nginx. If it reports an error, the file has a problem. Never reload nginx without testing first — a bad config can take the site down immediately."

        { text: "D) if file \"$DIR\"; then", isCorrect: false }
      ],
      explanation: "-d tests for directory. -f tests for file. -e tests for either. [ -d \"$DIR\" ] is the correct bash syntax for directory existence check. Always quote variables in bash — unquoted paths with spaces break scripts."

## 🎯 What I Deployed
- Launched EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04, t2.micro) via AWS CLI — no console GUI
- Configured security group with ports 22 and 80
- Installed and started nginx
- Served a live web page at: http://[EC2-PUBLIC-IP]
- Created deploy.sh automation script
- Set up EBS snapshot backups before server experiments

## ⌨️ AWS CLI Commands Used Today

\`\`\`bash
# Create root volume snapshot backup
INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
VOLUME_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].BlockDeviceMappings[0].Ebs.VolumeId' --output text)
aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id $VOLUME_ID --description "pre-experiment-backup"
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --query 'Snapshots[?Description==\`pre-experiment-backup\`].State'
\`\`\`

## 🐛 Errors I Hit and Fixed

| Error | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Site not loading in browser | Port 80 not in Security Group | Added inbound rule for port 80 |
| nginx config broke after edit | Missing semicolon | sudo nginx -t → found error line → fixed it |

## 🔑 Key Concepts Understood
- Security Group = EC2's firewall. Port 80 must be open for web traffic.
- nginx serves from /var/www/html/ by default
- systemctl reload applies config without dropping connections
- sudo nginx -t = ALWAYS run before reload
- EBS snapshots create immediate point-in-time storage backups`
