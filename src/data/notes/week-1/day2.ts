  interview: [
    {
      question: "Walk me through the git workflow — what happens when you make a change?",
      answer: "Git has three areas. The working directory is where you edit files. When a change is ready to be saved, I stage it with git add — this moves it to the staging area, also called the index. I then run git commit with a meaningful message, which permanently records that snapshot in the local repository. If I'm working with a team, I push to the remote — GitHub in most cases — using git push. Git pull brings other people's changes down to my local copy. The reason we have a staging area is intentional: it lets you commit only part of your changes, giving you fine-grained control over what goes in each commit."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does AWS have IAM and why shouldn't you use the root account?",
      answer: "The root account in AWS is the original account owner and has unrestricted access to everything — all services, all regions, all billing. IAM — Identity and Access Management — lets you create separate users and roles with only the permissions they actually need. This follows the principle of least privilege. If an IAM user's credentials are compromised, the damage is limited to what that user can do. If root credentials are compromised, an attacker has full control of your entire AWS account. In practice: I enable MFA on root, lock the root credentials away, and create an IAM user with AdministratorAccess for my daily work. In a company, individual team members would have even more restricted IAM roles — a developer might only be able to write to S3 and trigger Lambda, not touch EC2 or billing."
    },
    {
      question: "Walk me through how you'd use git in a team environment.",
      answer: "My workflow starts with pulling the latest main: git pull. Then I create a feature branch named after the work: git checkout -b feature/nginx-config-update. I do the work in small focused commits. If I need to switch context mid-task I stash unfinished work with git stash. When the feature is done, I push the branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request — a PR gives teammates a chance to review the code before it hits main. After the PR is approved and merged, I delete the branch both locally and on the remote. I never commit directly to main — main should always be in a deployable state."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between git revert and git reset?",
      answer: "Both undo changes but in fundamentally different ways. git revert creates a new commit that reverses the changes from a previous commit — the original commit stays in history. It's safe to use on any branch including shared ones because it doesn't rewrite history. git reset moves the HEAD pointer backwards — it can remove commits from history entirely. reset --hard also discards working directory changes. Reset is useful for cleaning up local commits before a first push, but you should never use it on a branch that teammates have already pulled from because it creates divergent histories that require a force push. My rule: revert on anything that's been pushed, reset only on strictly local work."

## 🎯 What I Learned Today
- Git three-area model: working directory → staging → repository
- The full commit cycle: add → commit → push
- Why root AWS credentials are dangerous and how IAM solves it
- AWS CLI installation and aws configure setup
- Set up CloudWatch billing alarms and AWS budgets for cost alerts
- Git branching model (checkout, merge, stash, revert, and logging)
- How named profiles protect credentials in AWS CLI config

## ⌨️ Git Commands Reference

\`\`\`bash
git init                          # Start a new repo
git checkout -b feature/name      # Create and switch branch
git stash && git stash pop        # Shelve and restore work
git revert COMMIT                 # Safe rollback
git log --oneline --graph --all   # View branches visually
\`\`\`

## ☁️ AWS Commands Reference

\`\`\`bash
aws configure --profile learning  # Named profile configuration
export AWS_PROFILE=learning       # Set active CLI profile
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm   # Set up billing alarm (in us-east-1!)
aws budgets create-budget         # Create monthly budget
aws sts get-caller-identity       # Check active user and account ID
\`\`\`

## 🔐 Security Decisions Made Today
- Created IAM user with AdministratorAccess for daily use
- Enabled MFA on root account
- Added .gitignore with *.pem, .env, *.log before first commit
- Configured CloudWatch billing alarm at $10 threshold for cost safety

## 🐛 Issues Hit Today
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| git push Auth Error | Personal Access Token (PAT) used instead of password |
| AWS CLI Auth Failure | Configured default profile vs learning profile mismatch fixed |

## 📈 Tomorrow (Day 3)
Launching EC2 via CLI, configuring security groups, deploying a live web server`
